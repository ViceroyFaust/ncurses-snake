# C++ Ncurses Snake
This is a simple ncurses snake implementation in C++.

## Compiling
Simply run `make` in your terminal and run the executable! The game uses ncurses, so make sure that the library is installed on your system. As far as I am aware, ncurses is Unix only.

## Running
When you run the executable, you will get a standard 16x16 snake game. If you wish to specify a custom arena size, add the following argument:

`SnakeGame --size [width] [height]`
